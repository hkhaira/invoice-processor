# Invoice Table Feature PRD

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements and specifications for implementing an interactive invoice table feature within the chat interface using the Vercel AI SDK's sheet block functionality.

## Problem Statement
Users need a way to view, edit, and manage processed invoices directly within the chat interface. Currently, there's no efficient way to display and interact with invoice data in a tabular format.

## Goals
- Enable users to view processed invoices in a structured table format
- Allow users to edit invoice details directly in the chat interface
- Support data export and analysis capabilities
- Maintain consistency with existing chat interface patterns

## Non-Goals
- Creating a separate invoice management system
- Implementing complex invoice processing workflows
- Adding invoice generation capabilities
- Supporting multiple table views simultaneously

1. View all processed invoices in a table format within the chat
2. Edit invoice details directly in the table
4. Export invoice data to CSV format
5. Sort invoice data by date, amount, and vendor
