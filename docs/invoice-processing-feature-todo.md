# Invoice Processing Feature Implementation Plan

## Implementation Sequence

### Step 1: Conversational UI for Invoice Processing
**Tasks:**
- Extend chat interface for invoice processing commands
- Implement real-time processing status updates
- Create user-friendly error messaging

**LLM Prompt:**
```
Enhance the existing chat interface to support invoice processing commands. Users should be able to type commands like "Process this invoice" to initiate the extraction workflow. Implement real-time status updates during processing using Vercel AI SDK streaming capabilities. The UI should provide clear feedback during the entire invoice processing workflow. Create user-friendly error messages for various failure scenarios.
```

**Manual Validation:**
- [ ] Verify the chat interface recognizes "Process this invoice" command
- [ ] Confirm the UI shows status updates during processing
- [ ] Test error handling by uploading an invalid file
- [ ] Check that the UI provides clear feedback to the user

### Step 2: File Upload Enhancement
**Tasks:**
- Ensure the existing file upload component handles PDF and image files
- Add file validation for accepted types and size
- Implement progress indicators

**LLM Prompt:**
```
Enhance the existing file upload component to specifically handle invoice files (PDFs and images). Implement client-side validation for file types and size limits. Add a progress indicator for file uploads. The component should capture the file data to be processed directly by the GPT-4o model.
```

**Manual Validation:**
- [ ] Test uploading PDF files and verify they're accepted
- [ ] Test uploading image files (JPG, PNG) and verify they're accepted
- [ ] Try uploading invalid file types and confirm rejection
- [ ] Verify progress indicator appears during upload
- [ ] Check client-side validation messages for invalid files

### Step 3: Direct File Processing with GPT-4o
**Tasks:**
- Set up file handling in the upload API route
- Configure file data preparation for GPT-4o
- Pass file data directly to the model without conversion

**LLM Prompt:**
```
Implement direct file processing using OpenAI's GPT-4o via Vercel AI SDK. GPT-4o can natively process both PDF documents and images without any conversion. Configure the API to receive the uploaded file, prepare it for AI processing by correctly formatting it as a message with file content, and return the appropriate response to the client.
```

**Manual Validation:**
- [ ] Upload a PDF invoice and verify it's processed by GPT-4o
- [ ] Upload an image invoice and verify it's processed without conversion
- [ ] Check that file data is correctly formatted for GPT-4o consumption
- [ ] Test with corrupted files and verify error handling
- [ ] Confirm the API returns appropriate responses to the client

### Step 4: AI Integration with Vercel AI SDK
**Tasks:**
- Set up Vercel AI SDK with OpenAI GPT-4o
- Create prompt template for invoice data extraction
- Implement streaming response handling
- Configure multi-modal input passing

**LLM Prompt:**
```
Integrate Vercel AI SDK v4.1 with OpenAI GPT-4o for invoice processing. Use the multi-modal capabilities of GPT-4o to directly process PDF files and images. Create a prompt template that instructs the AI to extract specific invoice fields (customer name, vendor name, invoice number, dates, amount, line items) from the document. Implement streaming response handling to provide real-time feedback to the user. Add timeout handling for processes that exceed 30 seconds.
```

**Manual Validation:**
- [ ] Verify AI SDK integration by checking for streaming responses
- [ ] Test with a sample invoice to see if fields are correctly extracted
- [ ] Check that streaming updates appear in the UI
- [ ] Test timeout handling by using a very large/complex document
- [ ] Verify extracted data structure matches expected format

### Step 5: Invoice Validation Logic
**Tasks:**
- Implement AI-based invoice validation
- Create feedback system for invalid invoices
- Set up rejection handling

**LLM Prompt:**
```
Develop an AI-based invoice validation system using GPT-4o via the Vercel AI SDK. The system should verify that uploaded documents are legitimate invoices by checking for required fields: invoice number, issue/due dates, vendor/customer information, itemized charges, and total amount. Create user-friendly feedback messages for invalid uploads, clearly explaining why a document was rejected (e.g., "This appears to be a receipt rather than an invoice").
```

**Manual Validation:**
- [ ] Test with a valid invoice and verify successful validation
- [ ] Test with a receipt or statement (not an invoice) and verify rejection
- [ ] Test with an invoice missing required fields and check feedback
- [ ] Verify rejection messages are clear and actionable
- [ ] Check that validation results are displayed to the user

### Step 6: Project Analysis and Schema Design
**Tasks:**
- Analyze existing file upload API
- Design invoice database schema with Drizzle ORM
- Define necessary models for invoice data storage

**LLM Prompt:**
```
Examine the existing codebase to understand the file upload functionality and database structure. Then design a Drizzle ORM schema for storing invoice data including: customer name, vendor name, invoice number, invoice date, due date, amount, and line items. Show the schema design and explain how it will be implemented.
```

**Manual Validation:**
- [ ] Review the proposed schema against PRD requirements
- [ ] Verify all required fields are included in the schema
- [ ] Check that relationship between invoices and line items is properly designed
- [ ] Ensure schema is compatible with Drizzle ORM
- [ ] Verify schema handles all data types correctly (dates, numbers, text)

### Step 7: Database Migration Setup
**Tasks:**
- Create Drizzle migration files for invoice schema
- Set up invoice validation utility functions
- Implement database operations for invoice data

**LLM Prompt:**
```
Create Drizzle ORM migration files for the invoice processing feature. Include tables for storing invoice metadata (customer name, vendor name, invoice number, dates, amounts) and line items. Create utility functions for database operations (save, retrieve invoices). The schema should support all the fields mentioned in the PRD.
```

**Manual Validation:**
- [ ] Run migrations and verify tables are created in SQLite
- [ ] Check that all fields are properly defined with correct data types
- [ ] Test utility functions with sample data
- [ ] Verify foreign key relationships work correctly
- [ ] Check for any migration errors in the console

### Step 8: Database Persistence Implementation
**Tasks:**
- Implement automatic storage of validated invoice data
- Create success feedback for completed processing
- Ensure proper error handling

**LLM Prompt:**
```
Implement functionality to automatically save validated invoice data to the SQLite database using Drizzle ORM. After successful validation using the AI, the extracted key information should be persisted in the database without user intervention. Implement success messages to inform users when invoice processing is complete. Ensure proper error handling for database operations.
```

**Manual Validation:**
- [ ] Process a valid invoice and verify data is saved to the database
- [ ] Check SQLite database to confirm all extracted fields are stored correctly
- [ ] Verify success message appears after successful processing
- [ ] Test error scenarios (DB connection issues, validation failures)
- [ ] Check that line items are properly associated with the invoice

### Step 9: Testing Framework
**Tasks:**
- Set up unit tests for invoice processing
- Create integration tests for end-to-end flow
- Implement test fixtures for invoice samples

**LLM Prompt:**
```
Create a testing framework for the invoice processing feature. Include unit tests for individual components (file upload, direct AI processing, validation) and integration tests for the end-to-end workflow. Develop test fixtures with sample invoice PDFs and images representing various formats and edge cases. Ensure tests validate the accuracy of data extraction and proper error handling.
```

**Manual Validation:**
- [ ] Run unit tests and verify they pass
- [ ] Check test coverage for all components
- [ ] Run integration tests with sample invoices
- [ ] Verify edge cases are properly tested
- [ ] Check that tests are properly isolated and don't affect production data

### Step 10: Error Handling & Edge Cases
**Tasks:**
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Add support for different invoice formats
- Handle network failures and AI service disruptions

**LLM Prompt:**
```
Enhance the invoice processing feature with comprehensive error handling for all possible failure points. Implement specific handling for different invoice formats, network failures, AI service disruptions, and database errors. Create user-friendly error messages that provide clear guidance on how to resolve issues. Test with a variety of edge cases to ensure robustness.
```

**Manual Validation:**
- [ ] Test with network disconnection during processing
- [ ] Verify timeout handling works correctly
- [ ] Test with various invoice formats from different vendors
- [ ] Check for proper error messages when API limits are exceeded
- [ ] Verify the system recovers gracefully from failures

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation will follow this sequence:
1. Start with the conversational UI (Step 1) to establish the user interaction flow
2. Then implement the file upload and direct AI processing (Steps 2-3)
3. Integrate AI processing for data extraction and validation (Steps 4-5)
4. Set up database persistence for validated invoice data (Steps 6-7-8)
5. Finally, add testing and error handling (Steps 9-10)

This approach allows us to build a functional prototype quickly and then enhance it with additional features.
